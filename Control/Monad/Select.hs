-- [Computation type:] Backtracking search, with @r@ as a \'ranking\' or
-- \'evaluation\' type.
--
-- [Binding strategy:] Binding a function to a monadic value \'chains together\'
-- strategies; having seen the result of one search, decide which policy to use
-- to continue.
--
-- [Useful for:] Search problems.
--
-- [Zero and plus:] None.
--
-- [Example type:] @'Control.Monad.Trans.Select.Select' r a@
--
-- = A note on commutativity
--
-- Some effects are /commutative/: it doesn't matter which you resolve first, as
-- all possible orderings of commutative effects are isomorphic. Consider, for
-- example, the reader and state effects, as exemplified by 'ReaderT' and
-- 'StrictState.StateT' respectively. If we have
-- @'ReaderT' r ('StrictState.State' s) a@, this is
-- effectively @r -> 'StrictState.State' s a ~ r -> s -> (a, s)@; if we instead have
-- @'StrictState.StateT' s ('Control.Monad.Trans.Reader.Reader' r) a@, this is effectively
-- @s -> 'Control.Monad.Trans.Reader' r (a, s) ~ s -> r -> (a, s)@. Since we
-- can always reorder function arguments (for example, using 'flip', as in
-- this case) without changing the result, these are
-- isomorphic, showing that reader and state are /commutative/, or, more
-- precisely, /commute with each other/.
--
-- However, this isn't generally the case. Consider instead the error and state
-- effects, as exemplified by 'MaybeT' and 'StrictState.StateT' respectively.
-- If we have @'MaybeT' ('Control.Monad.Trans.State.Strict.State' s) a@, this
-- is effectively @'State' s ('Maybe' a) ~ s -> ('Maybe' a, s)@: put simply,
-- the error can occur only in the /result/, but
-- not the state, which always \'survives\'. On the other hand, if we have
-- @'StrictState.StateT' s 'Maybe' a@, this is instead @s -> 'Maybe' (a, s)@: here,
-- if we error, we lose /both/ the state and the result! Thus, error and state effects
-- do /not/ commute with each other.
--
-- As the MTL is capability-based, we support any ordering of non-commutative
-- effects on an equal footing. Indeed, if you wish to use
-- 'Control.Monad.State.Class.MonadState', for
-- example, whether your final monadic stack ends up being @'MaybeT'
-- ('Control.Monad.Trans.State.Strict.State' s)
-- a@, @'StrictState.StateT' s 'Maybe' a@, or anything else, you will be able to write your
-- desired code without having to consider such differences. However, the way we
-- /implement/ these capabilities for any given transformer (or rather, any
-- given transformed stack) /is/ affected by this ordering unless the effects in
-- question are commutative.
--
-- We note in this module which effects the accumulation effect does and doesn't
-- commute with; we also note on implementations with non-commutative
-- transformers what the outcome will be. Note that, depending on how the
-- \'inner monad\' is structured, this may be more complex than we note: we
-- describe only what impact the \'outer effect\' has, not what else might be in
-- the stack.
--
-- = Commutativity of selection
--
-- The selection effect commutes with the identity effect ('IdentityT'), but
-- nothing else.
